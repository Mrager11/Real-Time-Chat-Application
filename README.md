Real-Time Chat Application
This is a simple Real-Time Chat Application built using Node.js, Socket.io, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to send and receive messages instantly between different users. The project demonstrates the basic functionality of a chat system with client-server communication in real-time.

Features
Real-time messaging between users.
Simple and clean UI for chat interaction.
Uses Socket.io for real-time bi-directional communication.
Easy to set up and run locally.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
NPM (comes installed with Node.js)
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the chat application running locally:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-chatapp.git
cd realtime-chatapp
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Run the Application
Start the Node.js server by running:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
By default, the server will start on port 5000. If port 5000 is already in use, the app will start on the next available port (e.g., 5001).

4. Open the Application in Your Browser
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:5000
How to Use the Chat Application
Enter your username when prompted.
Enter the username of the person you want to send a message to in the "Receiver's username" input field.
Type your message in the "Type a message..." input field.
Click the Send button to send the message.
Messages from other users will appear in the chat window in real-time.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
Express: A web framework for Node.js.
Socket.io: Enables real-time communication between clients and the server.
HTML/CSS: For the user interface of the chat application.
Future Improvements
Some potential improvements and features that could be added:

User Authentication: Add login/signup functionality.
Chat History: Store chat messages in a database like MongoDB for persistence.
Private/Group Chats: Allow users to create private chats or group conversations.
File Sharing: Enable file sharing in the chat (e.g., images, documents).
Troubleshooting
Error: EADDRINUSE: address already in use: This means the port 5000 is already in use. Either kill the process running on that port or change the port number in the index.js file.
If the app is slow to load, ensure your dependencies are up to date by running npm install.
